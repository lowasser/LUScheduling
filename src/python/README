Data loader for AJAX data from the ESP Web site

INSTALL
=======

The data_loader.py requires python version 2.6 or 2.7, along
with a couple dependencies defined in requirements.txt. If you
have pip installed, you can type the following at the terminal
to install the dependencies::

    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

LIST AVAILABLE PROGRAMS
=======================

To list the available programs, pass the -l flag to the program
along with the host, username, and password. For example::

    $ python data_loader.py -l --host esp.mit.edu -u axiak -p PASSWORD

EXAMPLE RUN (data loader)
=========================

Once you choose an appropriate program, to run the script needs the following
information:

  - hostname
  - username
  - password
  - program name
  - target data directory

For example::

    $ python data_loader.py -l --host esp.mit.edu -axiak -p PASSWORD -r Splash/2010 -t ../../data/2010Splash

Will generate the data files in the directory specified. Those files can then be turned into protobuf files
with the java already written.



EXAMPLE RUN (upload assignments)
================================

To upload assignments, you need to first generate a csv of the following form::

    section_id,room_id,period_id

Then you can run the following to load it into your desired setup::

    $ python upload_assignments.py --host esp.mit.edu -u axiak -p PASSWORD -r Splash/2011 -t CSV_FILE

This will execute a post to assign every single section.
